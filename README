		phoon - display current moon phase


phoon - program to display the PHase of the mOON.  Unlike other
such programs, which just tell you how long since first quarter
or something like that, phoon *shows* you the phase with a little
picture.  I've put an example at the end of this file.  I first
wrote this program in Pascal / TOPS-20 at CMU in 1979; I translated
it to Ratfor / Software Tools in 1981; and now it's in C / Unix.

Files in this distribution:

    README		this
    Makefile		guess
    phoon.c		phase of moon display
    astro.c		phase of moon calculations
    astro.h		header file
    phoon.1		manual for phase of moon program
    date_parse.c	date-parsing routine
    date_parse.h	header file

Unpack the files, edit Makefile and change the options to suit, make,
and enjoy!  Feedback is welcome - send bug reports, enhancements,
checks, money orders, etc. to the addresses below.
